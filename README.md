# SpellWritingGuideQtPy

This project takes the spell describing algorithms written by Gorilla of Destiny and described in his [Spell Writing Guide](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/429711/The-Spell-Writing-Guide?manufacturers_id=22808) and provides a mediocre user interface.

To run the program you can use the included batch file and shell scripts for linux and MacOS. You may have to use `chmod` and give the files permission.
